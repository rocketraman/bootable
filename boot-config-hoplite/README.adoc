# Bootable Configuration Module (Hoplite)

## Overview

## Usage

* `import(configModule)`, OR
* `import(configModule(...))`

Configuration loading can be customized with optional parameters to the `configModule()` function, providing additional stage 1, 2, or 3 config sources, as well as whether to use config reporting at startup, or to set secrets policies and obfuscators.

## Environment Variable Mapping Rules

The way Hoplite maps environment variables is a bit non-standard and non-idiomatic.

Ideally, Hoplite would support an approach that allows defining environment variables in an idiomatic way, mapping these to properties in a configuration class.

See https://github.com/sksamuel/hoplite/issues/410[hoplite issue #410].

A workaround is to be explicit about support env var overrides by using the env var preprocessor which is registered by default.
This allows defining properties with the syntax:

```
server {
  hostPort = "${SERVER_HOSTPORT:-8000}"
}
```

which would obtain this property from the `SERVER_HOSTPORT` environment variable, or default to `8000` if the environment variable is not set.

## Custom Types

Hoplite `Decoder` instances may be registered via the Java ServiceLoader framework, or registered via the `configModule` parameters.

## Reporting

By default, Hoplite will report on all config values that are loaded.
This can be disabled by setting the `report = false` parameter of the `configModule`.

A Hoplite `SecretsPolicy` passed to the `configModule will be used by the config loader.

By default, a value is considered a secret if any of the following are true:

* if a name contains "secret", "credential", or "pass" it is considered a secret
* if a config source provides metadata that indicates the value is a secret
* if the variable type is a Hoplite `Secret`.

A Hoplite `Obfuscator` passed to the `configModule` will be used by the config loader.

By default, values are strictly obfuscated.
